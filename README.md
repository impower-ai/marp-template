# Marp Introduction

[Marp](https://marp.app/) is a markdown presentation ecosystem. This means slides can be written as markdown, and styled with CSS. This reduces the need for copy templates and manually laying out slides.

# Usage

The easiest way to get started is to install the [Marp for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=marp-team.marp-vscode) extension. Once installed, you can add the ['impower.css'](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/impower-ai/marp-template/main/impower.css) theme under the "Themes" section.

Then, you can use CTRL-SHIFT-P to open a locked preview of the markdown document as a presentation, and additionally export the file to PDF, PPTX, or HTML.

# Examples

The 'example-presentation' file contains many examples of different usages, with notes indicated with the `<!-- -->` blocks.
